# Description
People will probably kill me for publishing such horrible code, but come on: it was 2007 when this experiment took place.
In the search for a good mailing list (which was still allowed by then) I made this little piece of code to be able to
crawl very specific email addresses from captcha images.

Nowadays the script probably wont run anymore, but it is still a good reference for people wanting to make a new application
using the same techniques.
